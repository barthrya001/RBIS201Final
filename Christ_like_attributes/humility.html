    <h3>Humility</h3>
    <p>
        To be humble is to recognize gratefully our dependence on the Lordâ€”to understand that we have constant need for His support. Humility is an acknowledgment that our talents and abilities are gifts from God. It is not a sign of weakness, timidity, or fear; it is an indication that we know where our true strength lies.
